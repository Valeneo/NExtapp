## Security Considerations

- Credentials are validated before generating embed links
- API keys are never exposed in client-side code
- All Notion API calls are made server-side
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Limitations

- Maximum 100 database entries per embed (for performance)
- Read-only access (no editing capabilities)
- Requires valid Notion integration with database access
